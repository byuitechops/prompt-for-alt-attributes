# Alt Attribute Checker
This program is designed to crawl a d2l export in a folder (chosen by the user, and unzipped), and find all the images embedded in HTML pages that are do not contain a valid (ADA compliant) alt text.
The program will inject those images onto the index.html page, and the user will add inputs for each image.
After the user submits all, the program writes to a new folder INSIDE of the d2l export folder with the updated files.

## Usage
1. Download this program [by clicking this link.](https://github.com/byuitechops/prompt-for-alt-attributes/archive/master.zip)
2. Once you've opened the folder in your file explorer, double click the file labelled "**run.cmd**"
3. Choose the desired folder and input the correct alt text for the images provided. 
4. After you are done, find the "updated files" folder with the timestamp on it. (If you would like, you can check the files for the new alt texts.)
5. You can upload all the files back up to D2L. 

## Errors
If you have any errors, please either alert TechOps Development or [create a new issue in this repository](https://github.com/byuitechops/prompt-for-alt-attributes/issues/new).
